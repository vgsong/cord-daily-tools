# cord-daily-tools

Daily automation tools used at work for Cordoba finance department and operations. 

Most of these scripts facilitates daily/weekly/monthly processes which can take considerable amount of preparation and manual steps due to its volume/frequency.

I started learning tkinter, and I am now moving to a PyQT library.

mainFACTORIO (currently retired) is the file that inherits all tkinter modules from classes folder. Much less crowded once I learned the OOP approach for tkinter.

mainATALHOSQ is the same as mainFACTORIO, but I have found that PyQT is more powerful and simpler than tkinter (in a way). I am trying to learn the OOP approach for PyQT, as of now, everything is in one file. (need to re-organize)
