# cord-daily-tools

Daily automation tools used at work for Cordoba finance department and operations. 

Most of these scripts facilitates daily/weekly/monthly processes which can take considerable amount of preparation and manual steps.

I started learning tkinter, and I am now moving to a PyQT library, which has more extensive resources.
